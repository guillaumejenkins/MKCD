# MKCD App Privacy Statement

This privacy statement explains what data is collected when you use the app, and how that data is used.

### Data Collected

- Errors and crashes inside the webapp are recorded
    - No personal data is recorded as part of these events; only the location in the webapp's code where the error occurred ("stack trace")
- High-level interactions with the webapp are recorded
    - For example: creating a new project, downloading your code to the device, switching to / from JavaScript, etc.
    - Specific / personal data is never recorded with these events (for example, your project code is never recorded inside these events)
- **No information** about the files and folders on your device is recorded
    - The app interacts with your system's file and folders when you choose to open a MakeCode binary file with the app, or save a project to a folder on your system, but the app **does not** record the name of the files / folders on your system, nor their content

### How Data is Used

- All data collected is completely anonymous
- All interaction data is viewed as aggregated reports to better understand how the app is used, with the sole purpose of improving popular features and reworking unpopular ones
- Error and crash events are viewed individually (but they are still completely anonymous), and are only used to detect bugs in the webapp and fix them
